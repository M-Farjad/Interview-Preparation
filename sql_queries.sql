-- cascade, restrict, set null
-- Foreign Key Rules
-- Ensure Referential Integrity:
-- Foreign key values in the employees table must exist in the departments table.
-- Behavior on Parent Table Changes:
-- CASCADE: Changes in the parent table automatically apply to child rows.
-- SET NULL: Setting a foreign key to NULL if the parent row is deleted or updated.
-- RESTRICT: Prevent changes in the parent if a foreign key reference exists.
